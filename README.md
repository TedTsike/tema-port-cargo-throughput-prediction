# Predicting Cargo Throughput at Tema Port Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting cargo throughput at Tema Port using machine learning models. The aim is to support port planning, infrastructure development, and operational decision-making through data-driven insights.

## Problem Statement
Ports require accurate cargo throughput forecasts to optimize resource allocation, reduce congestion, and plan future capacity. Traditional forecasting methods often fail to capture complex economic and operational relationships.

## Objective
- Predict monthly cargo throughput
- Evaluate the impact of macroeconomic indicators and port operational factors
- Compare traditional and machine learning models

## Data
The dataset includes:
- Macroeconomic indicators (inflation, exchange rate, CPI, M2)
- Port operational data (vessel traffic, cargo handled)
- Target variable: cargo throughput

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting
- Performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE

## Results
The Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance compared to Linear Regression and other models indicating the presence of non-linear relationships in cargo throughput dynamics.

## Practical Relevance
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to maritime logistics and port operations to support strategic planning and efficiency improvements.
